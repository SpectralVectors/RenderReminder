# RenderReminder
Blender Python - Send an email and play a sound when a render is finished!

This addon uses smtplib to send an email once your render is ready.

It uses Gmail and you will need to make sure that [Allow less secure apps is set to ON](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) to send the messages. 

I signed up for a separate Gmail account with lower security settings to use as my 'Send From' account, and that sends notification emails to my main email.

You can fork and customize for your own preferred email service.

The addon will also play a short Blender synthesized sound effect when the render is finished.

# RenderReminder
Blender Python - Send an email and play a sound when a render is finished!

This addon uses smtplib to send an email once your render is ready.

Check out [this][https://realpython.com/python-send-email/] page to see how your email needs to be set up to send the messages. I signed up for a separate Gmail account with lower security settings to use as my 'Send From' account, and that sends notification emails to my main email.

It will also play a short Blender synthesized sound effect.
